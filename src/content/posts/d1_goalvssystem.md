# Key differences between Goals and Systems

In psychology, a goal is a desired outcome or objective that an individual consciously or unconsciously strives to achieve. Goals serve as targets for our actions, guiding behavior and decision-making processes.

On the other hand, a system refers to a structured set of interrelated components that function together as a unified whole. In the context of psychology and personal development, systems are the processes and routines that individuals implement to achieve their goals.

So basically, **goals are what you want, and systems are how you get there.**

And here's the key idea: <br>
**If you focus solely on the goal, you might achieve it — once.
But if you focus on the system, you're far more likely to achieve the goal repeatedly, sustainably, and even exceed it.**

# Reasons why **System** is superior to **Goal**

1. **Both winners and losers strive for the same goal.**

    It’s something related to survivorship bias, those who won are heard to have great goals. It makes people believe that if they want to win, they have to share the same goals as these winners. But little do they know, those who lost have the same goals as the winners.

2. **A win is temporary.**

    Let’s assume that your room is messy and you have just enough energy to clean it. So it’s a win right? But after that, you keep your dirty habit, lazy to put thing in order and the room becomes messy one or two days later. So that win is just temporary, and in order to change, you have to alter your habit which is the system in this scenario.

3. **Goals limit your happiness.**

    People who prioritize goals usually allow them to be happy once they reach their goals. So most of the time, they are fraud and unfulfilled with what they are doing. On the other hand, one with passion to maintain their system love what they’re doing and keep on success.

4. **Goals will be dysfunctional in the long term.**

    If you have a goal and successfully reach it, then what will you do next? Biker or runner who has achieved their short-term goal tend to throw their career away, since they have nothing more to strive for. That’s why systems are important, it keeps going forever.
